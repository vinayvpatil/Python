    "#### Answer : re.compile()\n",
    "### 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "#### Answer :\n",
    "raw string (r\"text\") keeps regular expressions meaningful and confusion-free.\n",
    "backslash (\\\\) is used in Regular expressions to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Pythonâ€™s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals.\n",
    "eg. if we want to use (\\n) in the regular expression it might create a problem. Hence, Raw strings are used (e.g. r\"\\n\") so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "### 3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "#### Answer :\n",
    "re.search(pattern,string) method returns a matched pattern if found in the string else it returns a None"
