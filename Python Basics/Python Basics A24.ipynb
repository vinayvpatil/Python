    "**lamda expressions** are used to create Anonymous function. They can have any number of arguments, but it can have only one expression. It cannot contain any statements and it returns a function object which can be assigned to any variable. They can be used in the block they were created.          \n",

    "Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python’s runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations. They take life when interpreted by third party libraries, for example, mypy.            \n",

    "- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs.  \n",
