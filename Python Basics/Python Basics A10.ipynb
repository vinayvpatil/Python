    "### 4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method\n",
    "#### Answer :\n",
    "zipfile.ZipFile() function is equivalent to the File objects’ open() function.   \n",

    "### 5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.\n",
    "#### Answer : \n",
    "We have created a programme in which jpg and pdf files from one folder can be copied to new folder.  \n",
    "we have to input the destination_path of the folder where we want to copy the files  \n",
    "and input source_path of the folder from which we need to copy the files.  "
