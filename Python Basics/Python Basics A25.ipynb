    "Yield statement returns a value without exiting the function. Yield maintains the state between function calls, and resumes from where it left off when we call the next() method again. So if yield is called in the generator, then the next time the same generator is called we will pick right back up after the last yield statement."

    "- List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.       \n",
    "- List comprehension allows filtering while this is not possible in map. eg. to print all odd numbers  in range of 20, we can write [n for n in range(20) if n%2 != 0]. The same thing is not possible in map   \n",
    "- List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as final output but map only returns a map object.          \n",
