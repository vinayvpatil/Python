    "#### Answer :\n",
    "\\_\\_str\\_\\_ and \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ are two operator overloading methods that manage printing. <br>\n",
    "In Short, the difference between both these operators is the goal of \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ is to be unambiguous and \\_\\_str\\_\\_ is to be readable. <br>\n",

    "\\_\\_repr\\_\\_ is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development."

    "#### Answer :\n",
    "When we have two objects which are a physical representation of a class (user-defined data type) and we have to add two objects with binary ‘+’ operator it throws an error because compiler don’t know how to add two objects. So we define a method for an operator and that process is called operator overloading."
