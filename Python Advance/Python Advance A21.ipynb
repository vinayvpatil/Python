    "#### Answer :\n",
    "A probability distribution describes how a random variable is distributed. It tells us which values a random variable is most likely to take on and which values are less likely. Based on the previous data and the occurences of the random event, we can predict the outcome in terms of probabilities."

    "The difference between true random number(TRN) and pseudo-random number(PRN), is that TRN's are unpredictable physical values (like atmospheric noise), and PRN are generated using mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated).The PRN's are good enough as they follow a uniform distribution."
