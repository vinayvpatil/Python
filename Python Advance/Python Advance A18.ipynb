    "#### Answer :\n",
    "**Text files** are special subset of binary files that are used to store human readable characters as a rich text document or plain text document. Text files also store data in sequential bytes but bits in text file represents characters. <br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "**Binary files** are those typical files that store data in the form of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc) under a single file."

    "#### Answer :\n",
    "Text files are of small size and versatile. Kilobytes or megabytes are smaller than the same data stored in other formats, they can be rapidly and massively exchanged via email or disk. Most can be opened on computers running diverse operating systems, using very basic software. <br>\n",
