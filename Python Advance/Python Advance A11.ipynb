    "A metaclass is a class used to create a class. Metaclasses are usually subclasses of the type class. Just as a class functions as a template for the creation of objects, a metaclass functions as a template for the creation of classes. Metaclasses are sometimes referred to as class factories. We have redefine the inherited methods new() and init() within the custom metaclass that we define.\n",

    "Anything you can do with a class decorator, you can of course do with a custom metaclasses (just apply the functionality of the \"decorator function\", i.e., the one that takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's \\_\\_new\\_\\_ or \\_\\_init\\_\\_ that make the class object."

    "#### Answer :\n",
    "Both decorators and metaclass have some common things. When we want to aplly some common functionality to attributes of the class instances, both can be used. There are some problems which can be solved by decorators as well as by metaclasses. But there are a few problems that can only be solved by metaclasses. Use of metaclass affects its children while the decorator affects only the current class."
