    "### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "#### Answer :\n",
    "An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. <br>\n",
    "Whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation"

    "#### Answer :\n",

    "Where as assignment statements inside methods are treated as instance attributes or local attributes.\n",
    "When an instance of a class is created a single copy of class attributes is maintained and shared to all instances of class. where as each instance object maintains its own copy of instance variables."

    "### 3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass\\'s \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method?\n",
    "#### Answer :\n",
    "The main reason for always calling superclass's \\_\\_init\\_\\_is that super class may typically create member variable and initialize them to defaults. So if we don't call super class's init, none of that code would be executed and we would end up with super class that has no member variables. <br>\n",
    "If a child class has \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method, then it will not inherit the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method of the parent class. in other words the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method of the child class overrides the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method of the parent class. so we have to manually call a parent superclass's \\_\\_init\\_\\_ using super() method"
