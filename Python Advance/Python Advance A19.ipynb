    "#### Answer :\n",
    "Encapsulation describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method."
