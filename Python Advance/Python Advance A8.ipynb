    "#### Answer :\n",
    "Class-based exceptions are matched by superclass exceptions. A superclass in an exception handler will catch instances of the class and it's subclasses. So, superclass is like a general exception categories having more specific categories in it's subclass."

    "The **process()** method of LoggerAdapter is where the contextual information is added to the logging output. its passes the message and keyword arguments of the logging call, and it passes back modified versions of these to use in the call to the underlying logger.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Answer : \n",
    "1) We can use a custom __str__ opertaor overloading to display an exception object's error message. For general purpose, the built-in exception superclass will automatically display anything passed to the class constructor. Also, print and str operations can automatically display the error message through excetion object or by printing the error statement. <br>\n",
    "2) By using the Exception superclass which will raise the error by default."

    "#### Answer :\n",
    "String-based exceptions don't support categories, state information,or behaviour inheritance. So for bigger and complex programms it is not ideal. That's why we use class based exception now."
